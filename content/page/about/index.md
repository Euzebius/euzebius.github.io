## whoami
One more random dude on the Internet.  
I love hacking stuff, sometimes I break them, sometimes I fix them.  
I've been working on the field for nearly 2 decades now.  
I've also been hosting the French Hack The Box meetup for nearly 4 years now : [see site here](https://htb-meetup-france.super.site/).

## Why a blog?
Why not?  
I mean, I was born in the 80s, grew up in the 90s, so the good old Internet. Having a blog in the 90s was cool, I had multiple ones. One per hobby (including gamedev).  
But why now? Well, I need to motivate myself to keep doing stuff, and this is a way for me to stay commited. Don't want to get (r|d)usty.

## What will be presented here?
Everything that sparks in my mind and I consider worth sharing.  
Might be related to labs, hacking, hobbies, anything.  
Don't have too high expectation though.  
Sometimes it will be cool, sometimes it will be dull.  
Sorry not sorry, my place == my rules.
