# Welcome
Welcome on this blog!  
Why a blog in 2025 you might be asking?  
Mate, I'm asking the same.  
  
Turns out I sometimes have random thoughts or things I like to share, and sometimes X or LinkedIn might not be the best place to do this.  
I also don't like the fact that in a clap of hands my work could disappear if it's hosted on a social media platform.  

So here am I!

## Manifesto
What can you expect to find here?  
Well, mostly random thoughts on things and tech stuff.  
I'm interested in a lot of topics, so this be anything related to hacking or infosec.  
Sometimes other topics maybe.  

But keep one thing in mind.  
I'm not the best on any topic.  
I'm just here to share things with people.  
There might be mistakes in what I publish, feel free to reach out and I'll happily correct the mistake and quote you as a contibutor.

There will always be someone smarter, faster or stronger.  
I just want to share stuff.  

I won't talk about politics or religion here.  
There are places for personal beliefs and they don't include tech blogs imo.

Will I publish often?  
I don't know. I'd rather not publish anything than just throw useless stuff in here.

I'll try to organize posts as much as possible with categories and tags, but I'm sometimes messy so please forgive times when I'll just throw stuff and not put them in the appropriate box.  

Fell here randomly and you don't personally know me? Well, feel free to get to know me with the appropriate page ðŸ˜‡
