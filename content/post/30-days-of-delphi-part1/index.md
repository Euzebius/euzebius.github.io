# TL;DR
I've felt the urge to learn a new language and chose Delphi after a chat with bro DarkCoderSC.  
I created a "30 days" program bootcamp style using ChatGPT 4o because Laluka convinced me of the power of LLMs during a training I took with thim.  
I'll be randomly pushing updates as part of blog posts (not one per day, rather packed ones).  

# Delphi? In 2025? WTF Bro ?!

![Meme : Stay awhile and listen](/images/memes/deckard.jpg)
So, I was chatting with DarkCoderSC about the last snippet he published on [Malware Gallery](https://www.malwaregallery.com/) that reminded me of good old Sub7 times.  
And I must confess, I texted him "Bro, seriously, Delphi in 2025? Is it still any good for maldev nowadays?".  

After a quick chat he convinced me that people still have a bad opinion about Delphi because they got stuck on what Delphi 7 looked like.  
He even made me want to believe that Delphi will be cool again pretty soon.  

It's no secret that I keep chasing new projects and quickly get bored if it doesn't spark joy, so I saw an opportunity there to do two things I had planned to do for a long time :
1. Learn a new language
2. Get back to MalDev stuff

The problem was that I don't know shit about Delphi, didn't know where to start, what to do etc.  
So I decided to head to ChatGPT and have a chat with ~~Skynet~~ it. Why ChatGPT? I'm not much into the AI/LLM hype, but when I took a training at [Offenskill](https://offenskill.com) with Laluka, he got me hyped about how efficient ChatGPT could be for small, highly scoped tasks when you know how to ask.  

I did my best to make it create something cool.  

It gave me a syllabus that looked nice. So I asked it to build a Github repo with all the information, and break every "day task" into a specific folder with a dedicated readme.  

Guess what? It worked until day 4. The first 3 days were perfectly built, but it had been lazy for the last 27 ðŸ˜‚.  
I politely asked to finish the job and it did.  

So I created the public [30-domid repo on Github](https://github.com/Euzebius/30-domid).  
Want to take the challenge too?  
Clone and push ðŸ˜‡

## Cool story bro
ChatGPT built a program for me and I created a repo, now what you may ask?  

Well, I plan to release my progress on this path as multiple blog posts, and the source code in a dedicated branch.  
Do not expect one blog post per day of program, this will not happen.  
Do not expect one blog post per calendar day either, this is unlikely to happen too.  

But what I will do is publishing posts with multiple program days at once. Short enough to prevent brain from melting, but long enough not to think "cool, 30 seconds read, genius".  
I won't also treat this as an actual 30 calendar days program, but rather split it as one "day" is one task on its own and it should be achieved in less than a man-day of working on it, but I can do multiple days on the same calendar day or make the program day span over multiple calendar days.  
No commitment either on doing this daily for 30 days. But I will do it until reaching the end.  
I know, it might sound like a loser but remember, my place == my rules.  

And if you want an insight, I already completed day 1 yesterday quite easily. Yes, I know, installing Delphi 12 CE and creating a "hello world" console app makes me an absolute rockstar thank you! ðŸ˜‚
