&lt;p>Welcome on this blog!&lt;br>
Why a blog in 2025 you might be asking?&lt;br>
Mate, I&amp;rsquo;m asking the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out I sometimes have random thoughts or things I like to share, and sometimes X or LinkedIn might not be the best place to do this.&lt;br>
I also don&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that in a clap of hands my work could disappear if it&amp;rsquo;s hosted on a social media platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here am I!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="manifesto">Manifesto&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What can you expect to find here?&lt;br>
Well, mostly random thoughts on things and tech stuff.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a lot of topics, so this be anything related to hacking or infosec.&lt;br>
Sometimes other topics maybe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But keep one thing in mind.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;m not the best on any topic.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;m just here to share things with people.&lt;br>
There might be mistakes in what I publish, feel free to reach out and I&amp;rsquo;ll happily correct the mistake and quote you as a contibutor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will always be someone smarter, faster or stronger.&lt;br>
I just want to share stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t talk about politics or religion here.&lt;br>
There are places for personal beliefs and they don&amp;rsquo;t include tech blogs imo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Will I publish often?&lt;br>
I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I&amp;rsquo;d rather not publish anything than just throw useless stuff in here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll try to organize posts as much as possible with categories and tags, but I&amp;rsquo;m sometimes messy so please forgive times when I&amp;rsquo;ll just throw stuff and not put them in the appropriate box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fell here randomly and you don&amp;rsquo;t personally know me? Well, feel free to get to know me with the appropriate page ðŸ˜‡&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
