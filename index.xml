&lt;p>One more random dude on the Internet.&lt;br>
I love hacking stuff, sometimes I break them, sometimes I fix them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the field for nearly 2 decades now.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;ve also been hosting the French Hack The Box meetup for nearly 4 years now : &lt;a class="link" href="https://htb-meetup-france.super.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>see site here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-blog">Why a blog?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Why not?&lt;br>
I mean, I was born in the 80s, grew up in the 90s, so the good old Internet. Having a blog in the 90s was cool, I had multiple ones. One per hobby (including gamedev).&lt;br>
But why now? Well, I need to motivate myself to keep doing stuff, and this is a way for me to stay commited. Don&amp;rsquo;t want to get (r|d)usty.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-will-be-presented-here">What will be presented here?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Everything that sparks in my mind and I consider worth sharing.&lt;br>
Might be related to labs, hacking, hobbies, anything.&lt;br>
Don&amp;rsquo;t have too high expectation though.&lt;br>
Sometimes it will be cool, sometimes it will be dull.&lt;br>
Sorry not sorry, my place == my rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="resume">Resume&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>TODO&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome message and manifesto</title><link>https://euzebius.github.io/p/welcome-message-and-manifesto/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://euzebius.github.io/p/welcome-message-and-manifesto/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://euzebius.github.io/p/welcome-message-and-manifesto/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Welcome message and manifesto" />&lt;h1 id="welcome">Welcome&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Welcome on this blog!&lt;br>
Why a blog in 2025 you might be asking?&lt;br>
Mate, I&amp;rsquo;m asking the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out I sometimes have random thoughts or things I like to share, and sometimes X or LinkedIn might not be the best place to do this.&lt;br>
I also don&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that in a clap of hands my work could disappear if it&amp;rsquo;s hosted on a social media platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here am I!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="manifesto">Manifesto&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What can you expect to find here?&lt;br>
Well, mostly random thoughts on things and tech stuff.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a lot of topics, so this be anything related to hacking or infosec.&lt;br>
Sometimes other topics maybe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But keep one thing in mind.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;m not the best on any topic.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;m just here to share things with people.&lt;br>
There might be mistakes in what I publish, feel free to reach out and I&amp;rsquo;ll happily correct the mistake and quote you as a contibutor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will always be someone smarter, faster or stronger.&lt;br>
I just want to share stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t talk about politics or religion here.&lt;br>
There are places for personal beliefs and they don&amp;rsquo;t include tech blogs imo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Will I publish often?&lt;br>
I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I&amp;rsquo;d rather not publish anything than just throw useless stuff in here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll try to organize posts as much as possible with categories and tags, but I&amp;rsquo;m sometimes messy so please forgive times when I&amp;rsquo;ll just throw stuff and not put them in the appropriate box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fell here randomly and you don&amp;rsquo;t personally know me? Well, feel free to get to know me with the appropriate page ðŸ˜‡&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://euzebius.github.io/archives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://euzebius.github.io/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://euzebius.github.io/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://euzebius.github.io/links/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here you will find a list of projects, people or organizations I appreciate.&lt;br>
