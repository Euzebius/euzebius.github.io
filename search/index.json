[{"content":"TL;DR I\u0026rsquo;ve felt the urge to learn a new language and chose Delphi after a chat with bro DarkCoderSC.\nI created a \u0026ldquo;30 days\u0026rdquo; program bootcamp style using ChatGPT 4o because Laluka convinced me of the power of LLMs during a training I took with thim.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be randomly pushing updates as part of blog posts (not one per day, rather packed ones).\nDelphi? In 2025? WTF Bro ?! So, I was chatting with DarkCoderSC about the last snippet he published on Malware Gallery that reminded me of good old Sub7 times.\nAnd I must confess, I texted him \u0026ldquo;Bro, seriously, Delphi in 2025? Is it still any good for maldev nowadays?\u0026rdquo;.\nAfter a quick chat he convinced me that people still have a bad opinion about Delphi because they got stuck on what Delphi 7 looked like.\nHe even made me want to believe that Delphi will be cool again pretty soon.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s no secret that I keep chasing new projects and quickly get bored if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t spark joy, so I saw an opportunity there to do two things I had planned to do for a long time :\nLearn a new language Get back to MalDev stuff The problem was that I don\u0026rsquo;t know shit about Delphi, didn\u0026rsquo;t know where to start, what to do etc.\nSo I decided to head to ChatGPT and have a chat with Skynet it. Why ChatGPT? I\u0026rsquo;m not much into the AI/LLM hype, but when I took a training at Offenskill with Laluka, he got me hyped about how efficient ChatGPT could be for small, highly scoped tasks when you know how to ask.\nI did my best to make it create something cool.\nIt gave me a syllabus that looked nice. So I asked it to build a Github repo with all the information, and break every \u0026ldquo;day task\u0026rdquo; into a specific folder with a dedicated readme.\nGuess what? It worked until day 4. The first 3 days were perfectly built, but it had been lazy for the last 27 ðŸ˜‚.\nI politely asked to finish the job and it did.\nSo I created the public 30-domid repo on Github.\nWant to take the challenge too?\nClone and push ðŸ˜‡\nCool story bro ChatGPT built a program for me and I created a repo, now what you may ask?\nWell, I plan to release my progress on this path as multiple blog posts, and the source code in a dedicated branch.\nDo not expect one blog post per day of program, this will not happen.\nDo not expect one blog post per calendar day either, this is unlikely to happen too.\nBut what I will do is publishing posts with multiple program days at once. Short enough to prevent brain from melting, but long enough not to think \u0026ldquo;cool, 30 seconds read, genius\u0026rdquo;.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t also treat this as an actual 30 calendar days program, but rather split it as one \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo; is one task on its own and it should be achieved in less than a man-day of working on it, but I can do multiple days on the same calendar day or make the program day span over multiple calendar days.\nNo commitment either on doing this daily for 30 days. But I will do it until reaching the end.\nI know, it might sound like a loser but remember, my place == my rules.\nAnd if you want an insight, I already completed day 1 yesterday quite easily. Yes, I know, installing Delphi 12 CE and creating a \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; console app makes me an absolute rockstar thank you! ðŸ˜‚\n","date":"2025-04-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/a/a1/Delphi-logo-1024.png","permalink":"https://blog.euz.me/p/30-days-of-maldev-in-delphi-part-1/","title":"30 Days Of Maldev In Delphi - Part 1 "},{"content":"Welcome Welcome to this blog!\nWhy a blog in 2025 you might be asking?\nMate, I\u0026rsquo;m asking the same.\nTurns out I sometimes have random thoughts or things I like to share, and sometimes X or LinkedIn might not be the best place to do this.\nI also don\u0026rsquo;t like the fact that in a clap of hands my work could disappear if it\u0026rsquo;s hosted on a social media platform.\nSo here am I!\nManifesto What can you expect to find here?\nWell, mostly random thoughts on things and tech stuff.\nI\u0026rsquo;m interested in a lot of topics, so this be anything related to hacking or infosec.\nSometimes other topics maybe.\nBut keep one thing in mind.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not the best on any topic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just here to share things with people.\nThere might be mistakes in what I publish, feel free to reach out and I\u0026rsquo;ll happily correct the mistake and quote you as a contibutor.\nThere will always be someone smarter, faster or stronger.\nI just want to share stuff.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t talk about politics or religion here.\nThere are places for personal beliefs and they don\u0026rsquo;t include tech blogs imo.\nWill I publish often?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know.
