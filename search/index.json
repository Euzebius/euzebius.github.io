[{"content":"Welcome Welcome to this blog!\nWhy a blog in 2025 you might be asking?\nMate, I\u0026rsquo;m asking the same.\nTurns out I sometimes have random thoughts or things I like to share, and sometimes X or LinkedIn might not be the best place to do this.\nI also don\u0026rsquo;t like the fact that in a clap of hands my work could disappear if it\u0026rsquo;s hosted on a social media platform.\nSo here am I!\nManifesto What can you expect to find here?\nWell, mostly random thoughts on things and tech stuff.\nI\u0026rsquo;m interested in a lot of topics, so this be anything related to hacking or infosec.\nSometimes other topics maybe.\nBut keep one thing in mind.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not the best on any topic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just here to share things with people.\nThere might be mistakes in what I publish, feel free to reach out and I\u0026rsquo;ll happily correct the mistake and quote you as a contibutor.\nThere will always be someone smarter, faster or stronger.\nI just want to share stuff.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t talk about politics or religion here.\nThere are places for personal beliefs and they don\u0026rsquo;t include tech blogs imo.\nWill I publish often?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know. I\u0026rsquo;d rather not publish anything than just throw useless stuff in here.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll try to organize posts as much as possible with categories and tags, but I\u0026rsquo;m sometimes messy so please forgive times when I\u0026rsquo;ll just throw stuff and not put them in the appropriate box.\nFell here randomly and you don\u0026rsquo;t personally know me? Well, feel free to get to know me with the appropriate page ðŸ˜‡\n","date":"2025-04-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.euz.me/p/welcome-message-and-manifesto/cover_hu4b5f379b55cd7e38a03facb9929eae6a_71697_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.euz.me/p/welcome-message-and-manifesto/","title":"Welcome message and manifesto"}]
